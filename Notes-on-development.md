Branching
---------

The project adopts @nvie's branching model

The "develop" branch contains work-in-progress code: the unit of branching is a feature/enhancement. From the "develop" branch, new "feature" branches which will be opened.

The "master" branch will contain only stable code and the "develop" branch will be merged back into it only when a milestone is completed.

Bug fixes will be done as "hotfixes" stemming out of the "master" branch and then will be merged back in both "master" and "develop" branch.

"feature" and "hotfix" branches can be opened by any contributor: once terminated, please send a pull request and I'll merge. Merging of "develop" into "master" will be done by myself when releasing.
