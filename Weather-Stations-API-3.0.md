# Study of OWM Weather Stations API

You can use the OWM API to manage your own meteostations and to publish real weather data to the OWM API service, thus helping to improve the quality of the overall weather forecasts.
Moreover, you can get punctual and aggregated data related to your stations' measurements.

This API is still in _beta testing_.

# API methods

# Object model

We already have an entity (`webapi25.station.Station`) representing a meteostation, it's worth of reuse.

# High-level PyOWM API
