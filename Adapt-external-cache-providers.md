If you want to leverage external cache systems in combination with PyOWM, it is possible to write custom adapters for them and inject the adapters into PyOWM code.

For your convenience, you can find drafts for a few adapters in the [pyowm-cache-adapters GitHub repo](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm-cache-adapters).

An example on how to write and wire a custom adapter is described in details [here](http://claudiosparpaglione.wordpress.com/2013/12/13/how-to-use-memcached-with-pyowm/).
